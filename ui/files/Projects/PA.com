Please report any issues before disabling HTTP/2 support: https://golang.org/s/http2bug

The http package's Transport and Server both automatically enable HTTP/2 support for simple configurations. To enable HTTP/2 for more complex configurations, to use lower-level HTTP/2 features, or to use a newer version of Go's http2 package, import "golang.org/x/net/http2" directly and use its ConfigureTransport and/or ConfigureServer functions. Manually configuring HTTP/2 via the golang.org/x/net/http2 package takes precedence over the net/http package's built-in HTTP/2 support.
